How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Shows me only the differences, and help me going straight to the fault

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Helps go through the changes and go back and forward

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You commit based on your personal needs, so you get real important commints
with real staff.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes multiple files commits are necesary but with some other projects 
doesn't really matter.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First we use git log to have the historic of changes, the diff to compare 
them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to a previus state where everything was working.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To take care of my different versions of code
